# DeFi vs CeFi

CeFi and DeFi are two different paradigms for financial services.

CeFi, or Centralized Finance, refers to traditional financial services that are centralized and controlled by a central authority, such as a bank or a financial institution. CeFi platforms often require users to go through a Know Your Customer (KYC) process to verify their identity, and they generally have strict rules and regulations that govern how users can use the platform.

DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, on the other hand, refers to financial services that are built on top of decentralized networks, such as blockchain technology. DeFi platforms are often open and permissionless, meaning that anyone can use them without needing to go through a KYC process or seek permission from a central authority. DeFi platforms are typically run by smart contracts, which are self-executing computer programs that automatically execute transactions based on predetermined rules.

The key difference between CeFi and DeFi is the centralization vs decentralization of the platforms. CeFi platforms are centralized and controlled by a central authority, while DeFi platforms are decentralized and run by smart contracts. Additionally, CeFi platforms often require users to go through a KYC process, while DeFi platforms generally do not.
