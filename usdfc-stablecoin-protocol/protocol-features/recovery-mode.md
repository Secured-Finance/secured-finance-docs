# ðŸ’ž Recovery Mode

**Recovery Mode** is activated when the **Total Collateral Ratio (TCR)** of the protocol falls below **150%**. It is designed to protect the protocol from a systemic risk of under-collateralization by prioritizing debt repayment and collateral distribution.

## Key Changes During Recovery Mode

1. **Liquidation Threshold Jump (110% to TCR)**\
   Troves with a collateral ratio below **TCR** are **immediately eligible for liquidation**, receiving a **10% penalty** upon liquidation.
2. **Zero Minting Fee**\
   The borrowing fee is set to **0%**, encouraging users to add collateral and stabilize the protocol.
3. **Minting Restrictions**\
   Borrowing that would lower the **TCR** is blocked. New USDFC can only be issued if it improves a Troveâ€™s collateral ratio or establishes a new Trove at **150% or higher**.\
   Adjustments reducing collateral ratio are permitted only if the resulting TCR exceeds 150%.

## **Purpose**

The goal of Recovery Mode is to restore the **TCR to 150% or higher** and prevent a cascade of liquidations that could threaten the protocolâ€™s stability.

**Risk to Trove Holders**

* Trove holders should maintain a **high collateral ratio** during Recovery Mode to avoid liquidation.
* **Low-collateral Troves** (below 150%) are more vulnerable and can be liquidated immediately.

**Example Scenario**

1. The TCR falls to **145%**, triggering Recovery Mode.
2. Troves below **TCR (145%)** are prioritized for liquidation.
3. Users are incentivized to add collateral to protect their positions and restore system stability.

* ICR = Individual Collateral Ratio
* MCR = Minimum Collateral Ratio (110%)
* TCR = Total Collateral Ratio
* SP = Stability Pool
