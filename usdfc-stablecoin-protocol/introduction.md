## Why **Secured Finance launch Stablecoin protocol?**

Secured Finance is a decentralized financial platform that aims to provide institutional-grade capabilities and greater financial flexibility for everyone, offering more liquidity and new ways to grow your digital assets.

We have two core protocols: [**Fixed Income Lending**](https://app.secured.finance/) and the [**USDFC** **Stablecoin**](https://usdfc.secured.finance/). Each protocol addresses the distinct needs of DeFi users by delivering both fixed-income investment opportunities and flexible borrowing solutions for digital assets.&#x20;

Through **Fixed Income Lending**, users can borrow and lend at fixed rates, structured as zero-coupon bonds and tokenized debt. This setup ensures predictable and stable returns for specific time periods, appealing to those seeking secure, fixed-rate yields.

We introduce the **USDFC Stablecoin** to provide immediate access to a USD-pegged stablecoin without requiring a traditional counterparty or relying on external liquidity for exchange. The system enables you to open a **Trove** where you can manage your collateral and debt, offering a decentralized and efficient way to mint, borrow, and repay **USDFC**.

By integrating a stablecoin into the Secured Finance ecosystem, USDFC can seamlessly connect with Fixed Income Lending market, serving as a ready source of order book liquidity. In turn, this gives USDFC added utility, allowing it to earn stable returns within the protocol.

## **The Role of USDFC in the Filecoin Ecosystem**

USDFC is exclusively backed by **Filecoin**, with all operations occurring on the **Filecoin Virtual Machine** (FVM). By choosing Filecoin as collateral, we leverage its robust ecosystem, which is poised for growth amid rising data storage needs in the AI-driven era.

Through direct integration of **USDFC** stablecoin on the FVM, Secured Finance aims to boost Filecoinâ€™s DeFi landscape as MakerDAO's DAI did for Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. As the first decentralized stablecoin fully collateralized by Filecoin, USDFC provides liquidity for Filecoin stakeholders, miners, and DeFi users alike. This, in turn, strengthens liquidity across the Filecoin network and establishes a solid basis for expanded DeFi development.

Secured Finance envisions delivering financial flexibility to everyone and spurring DeFi sector growth via stablecoin and fixed-income marketsâ€”supported by Filecoin and the wider blockchain community. By leveraging the FVM, our protocol promotes stability and composability for Filecoin assets, adding another layer of utility to the network and advancing the sustainable, long-term development of the Filecoin economy.
