# Bridge

The [**Bridge tab**](https://app.secured.finance/bridge/) lets you easily transfer assets between different blockchain networks directly within the Secured Finance platform. Powered by **Axelar**, it provides a simple and secure way to perform cross-chain swaps without the need for external exchanges.

### What You Can Do with the Bridge

* **Cross-Chain Swaps**: Exchange tokens from one blockchain network to another (e.g., swap USDC on Ethereum for FIL on the Filecoin network).
* **Obtain Native Tokens**: Acquire native tokens required for transaction fees on other networks, such as FIL for the Filecoin network or ETH for Ethereum.
* **Expand Your Portfolio**: Access assets and opportunities available on multiple blockchain networks.

### How to Use the Bridge

1. **Connect Your Wallet**
   * Click **Connect Wallet** at the top right corner.
2. **Select Networks and Tokens**
   * **From Network**: Choose the blockchain and token you are swapping from (e.g., Ethereum and USDC).
   * **To Network**: Select the destination blockchain and token you want to receive (e.g., Filecoin and FIL).
3. **Enter the Amount**
   * Specify the amount of the token you wish to swap.
4. **Approve Token Use**
   * If prompted, click **Give Permission to Use Token**.
5. **Review and Confirm**
   * Check the transaction details, including estimated time and fees.
6. **Verify Receipt**
   * Once completed, check your wallet on the destination network to confirm the arrival of your tokens.
