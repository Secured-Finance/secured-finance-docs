# ðŸ“ˆ The Graph

## Overview

The Graph is a decentralised protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data, making it easier to query the difficult-to-read data stored on the blockchain.&#x20;

But why Subgraph, if we could use a dedicated server to process transactions and store the information in a database? Yeah, we could, but this approach is resource-intensive, requires maintenance, introduces the single point of failure and compromises the decentralisation and security properties crucial for a web3 application. The Graph's decentralised approach ensures resilience, eliminating the need for centralised and resource-intensive alternatives.

## Secured Finance Subgraphs

To view the source of our subgraphs, visit our [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Secured-Finance/secured-finance-subgraph).

We have dedicated subgraphs for each blockchain we support. They use the same schemas.
