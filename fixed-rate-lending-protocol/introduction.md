# ðŸ“¢ Introduction

### **Secured Finance: A Fixed-Rate DeFi Protocol**

Secured Finance began in 2020 at a hackathon, where we set out to create an [**Orderbook-based Rates DeFi Trading Platform**](https://docs.secured.finance/fixed-rate-lending-protocol/full-on-chain-orderbook) on Ethereum. Our goal was to enable lending and borrowing of digital assets and establish yield curves in the DeFi ecosystem. Since then, weâ€™ve evolved into a fully on-chain, fixed-rate, fixed-term lending and borrowing platform. As of 2025, our [**WebApp**](https://app.secured.finance/) operates seamlessly across Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Filecoin chains.

At the core of our platform is a unique Zero-Coupon Bond instrument, powering secure and efficient crypto asset lending and borrowing. We simplify the complexities of traditional bond and loan lifecycle management, delivering a transparent, cost-effective, and user-friendly alternative. Whether youâ€™re a borrower or an investor, Secured Finance offers a streamlined DeFi experience.

### Expanding into the Future&#xD;

In 2025, as DeFi evolves and traditional capital flows into Real-World Assets (RWA) and stablecoins, Secured Finance is broadening its horizons. Weâ€™ve introduced RWA-collateralized finance solutions, including a Filecoin-backed stablecoin and expanded token lending options for our community. Join us as we redefine the future of decentralized finance.
