## Executive Summary <a href="#d5df" id="d5df"></a>

Secured Finance is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that provides a unique solution to the liquidity problem in the industry. Our protocol enables peer-to-peer lending and derivatives trading for fixed-income investments and hedging, offering a more efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional financial institutions.

By utilizing a smart-contract-based platform, we eliminate the need for intermediaries and provide a transparent, robust, censorship-resistant, and low-cost way of transacting. Our OTC market for digital assets ensures that primary and secondary markets have enough liquidity, while our smart-contract-based central clearing counterparty model guarantees transparent and efficient transactions.

Moreover, our unique features, including the standardization of plain vanilla products, order-book-based price discovery, on-chain orderbook matchmaking, smart-contract-based collateral management, and auto-rolling, provide a hassle-free solution that benefits long-term investors and borrowers. These features offer a solution to the DeFi industryâ€™s challenges, paving the way for an inclusive, accessible, and efficient financial system.

Secured Finance has a clear roadmap for growth, a strong use case and a dedicated team committed to building a strong and vibrant community around the Secured Finance ecosystem. We welcome anyone who shares our vision to join us on this exciting journey.
