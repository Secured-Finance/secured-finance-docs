## What is Secured Finance Points (SFP) v2?

Secured Finance Points (SFP) v2 is a simplified and user-friendly reward system designed to enhance user experience while reflecting individual contributions to the Secured Finance Protocol. These electronic points serve as a versatile metric to quantify user engagement, determine community rankings, and allocate rewards in a transparent and equitable manner. By streamlining the system, SFP v2 ensures a seamless and rewarding experience for all participants.

## **When is the SFP launch?**

The point system pre-launch phase started on the Filecoin blockchain on **June 19, 2024**, at 12:00 AM (UTC). The global launch followed on **June 28, 2024**, at 12:00 AM (UTC), expanding to Ethereum, Arbitrum, Avalanche, and Polygon zkEVM. The updated **v2 system** will be implemented starting **December 27, 2024** at 12:00 AM(UTC). Accumulated points will remain intact, and new points will be added to the existing totals.

## SFP and SFC

**SFP**: Non-transferable points with no economic value, representing user activities and contributions.

**SFC**: Governance tokens distributed periodically, using SFP as a reference for reward calculations.

* Initially, **1% of the total SFC supply** is allocated for airdrops.
* This allocation can increase to:
  * **2%** if the protocol's TVL reaches **$50M**.
  * **3%** if TVL reaches **$100M**.

Original contributors from early campaigns will be rewarded separately with SFC tokens, acknowledging their foundational support.

## How to earn SFP?

SFP can be earned through various activities within the Secured Finance ecosystem:

* Increasing TVL.
* Providing order-book liquidity.
* Introducing new users via referrals.
* Logging in daily to the platform.
